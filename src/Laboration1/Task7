If there exists a large start value for which the answer is no, it means that the corresponding sequence generated by the start value 
will never reach the number 1, but instead enter into an infinite loop of non-repeating terms. If we run such an input on our program, 
the program will keep computing the life length of the number but never terminate, since the sequence never reaches the number 1. In other words, 
the program will run indefinitely without giving any output, which would make it practically useless for finding the life length of such start values.
